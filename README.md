PSO-tool


This is a personal project develop for academic purpose.
Here only a briefly presentation, you can find al specs in the reference paper "PSO_tool.pdf" attached.

Summarize this is an optimization tool, wrote in Python 3, which allows to use different Particle Swarp Optimization algorithms to minimize an user-defined function.

It develop three different algorithms to solve linear and non linear constrained problems.

It's sufficient insert your function (as specified in the paper) in the benchmark_function file and choose the method to use.  Also some different processes to create the population are available.

With spirit of sharing and hoping that it may be of help to someone else,
Good luck!
